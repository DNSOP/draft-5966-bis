            <t> This document specifies the requirement for support of TCP as a
                transport protocol for DNS implementations and provides
                guidelines towards DNS-over-TCP performance on par with that
                of DNS-over-UDP. </t>

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t> Most <xref target="RFC1034">DNS</xref> transactions take place over
                <xref target="RFC0768">UDP</xref>. <xref target="RFC0793">TCP</xref> is always used
                for full zone transfers (AXFR) and is often used for messages whose sizes exceed the
                DNS protocol's original 512-byte limit. The growing deployment of DNSSEC and IPv6
                has increased response sizes and therefore the use of TCP (TODO: add reference).
                Another strong motivation for TCP use is defending against reflection/amplification
                attacks (for example with RRL) and cache poisoning (TODO: add references).</t>

            <t> Section 6.1.3.2 of <xref target="RFC1123"/> states:
                <list><t><vspace/>DNS resolvers and recursive servers MUST support UDP, and SHOULD
                support TCP, for sending (non-zone-transfer) queries.</t>
                </list></t>

            <t> However, some implementors have taken the text quoted above to mean that TCP support
                is an optional feature of the DNS protocol.</t>

            <t> The majority of DNS server operators already support TCP and the default
                configuration for most software implementations is to support TCP. The primary
                audience for this document is those implementors whose failure to support TCP
                restricts interoperability and limits deployment of new DNS features.</t>

            <t> QUESTION: We are now going a lot further than this so maybe we should say "failure
                to fully support"?</t>

            <t> This document therefore updates the core DNS protocol specifications such that
                support for TCP is henceforth a REQUIRED part of a full DNS protocol
                implementation.</t>

            <t> There are several advantages and disadvantages to the increased use of
                TCP as well as implementation details that need to be considered.
                This document addresses these
                issues and therefore extends the content of <xref target="RFC5966"/>, with
                additional considerations and lessons learned from research, developments
                and implementation in DNS and in other internet protocols. </t>

            <t> Whilst this document makes no specific requirements for operators of DNS
                servers to meet, it does offer some suggestions to operators to help
                ensure that support for TCP on their servers and network is optimal.
                It should be noted that failure to support TCP (or the blocking of DNS over TCP at
                the network layer) may result in resolution failure and/or application-level
                timeouts. </t>

                <t> Persistent connection: a TCP connection that is not closed either by the
                    server after sending the first response nor by the client after receiving
                    the first response. </t>
                <t> Connection Reuse: the sending of multiple queries and responses
                    over a single TCP connection.</t>
                <t> Idle DNS-over-TCP session: Application level idleness is viewed differently from
                    the client and server perspective. A DNS client considers a DNS-over-TCP session
                    to be idle when it has no pending queries to send and there are no outstanding
                    responses. A DNS server considers a DNS-over-TCP session to be idle when it has
                    sent responses to all the queries it has received on that connection.</t>
                <t> Pipelining: the sending of multiple queries and responses over a single TCP
                    connection but not waiting for any outstanding replies before sending another
                    query.</t>
                <t> Out-Of-Order Processing: The processing of queries concurrently
                    and the returning of individual responses as soon as they are
                    available, possibly out-of-order. This will most likely occur in
                    recursive servers, however it is possible in authoritative servers
                    that, for example, have different backend data stores. </t>
                </list>
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Discussion">
            <t> In the absence of EDNS0 (Extension Mechanisms for DNS 0) (see below), the normal
                behaviour of any DNS server needing to send a UDP response that would exceed the
                512-byte limit is for the server to truncate the response so that it fits within
                that limit and then set the TC flag in the response header. When the client receives
                such a response, it takes the TC flag as an indication that it should retry over TCP
                instead.</t>

            <t> RFC 1123 also says:
                <list><t><vspace/>... it is also clear that some new DNS record types defined in the
                    future will contain information exceeding the 512 byte limit that applies to
                    UDP, and hence will require TCP. Thus, resolvers and name servers should
                    implement TCP services as a backup to UDP today, with the knowledge that
                    they will require the TCP service in the future.</t></list></t>

            <t> Existing deployments of <xref target="RFC4033">DNS Security (DNSSEC)</xref> have
                shown that truncation at the 512-byte boundary is now commonplace. For example, a
                Non-Existent Domain (NXDOMAIN) (RCODE == 3) response from a DNSSEC-signed zone using
                <xref target="RFC5155">NextSECure 3 (NSEC3)</xref> is almost invariably larger
                than 512 bytes.</t>

            <t> Since the original core specifications for DNS were written, the Extension
                Mechanisms for DNS (<xref target="RFC6891">EDNS0</xref>) have been introduced. These
                extensions can be used to indicate that the client is prepared to receive UDP
                responses larger than 512 bytes. An EDNS0-compatible server receiving a request from
                an EDNS0-compatible client may send UDP packets up to that client's announced buffer
                size without truncation.</t>

            <t> However, transport of UDP packets that exceed the size of the path MTU causes IP
                packet fragmentation, which has been found to be unreliable in many circumstances.
                Many firewalls routinely block fragmented IP packets, and some do not implement the
                algorithms necessary to reassemble fragmented packets. Worse still, some network
                devices deliberately refuse to handle DNS packets containing EDNS0 options. Other
                issues relating to UDP transport and packet size are discussed in
                <xref target="RFC5625"/>.</t>

            <t> The MTU most commonly found in the core of the Internet is around 1500 bytes, and
                even that limit is routinely exceeded by DNSSEC-signed responses. </t>

            <t> The future that was anticipated in RFC 1123 has arrived, and the only standardised
                UDP-based mechanism that may have resolved the packet size issue has been found
                inadequate.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Transport Protocol Selection" anchor="selection">
            <t> All general-purpose DNS implementations MUST support both UDP and TCP transport.</t>
            <t><list style="symbols">
                    <t> Authoritative server implementations MUST support TCP so that they do not
                        limit the size of responses to what fits in a single UDP packet.</t>
                    <t> Recursive server (or forwarder) implementations MUST support TCP so that
                        they do not prevent large responses from a TCP-capable server from reaching
                        its TCP-capable clients.</t>
                    <t> Stub resolver implementations (e.g., an operating system's DNS resolution
                        library) MUST support TCP since to do otherwise would limit their
                        interoperability with their own clients and with upstream servers. </t>
                </list></t>

            <t> Regarding the choice of when to use UDP or TCP, Section 6.1.3.2 of RFC 1123 also
                says: <list><t><vspace/>... a DNS resolver or server that is sending a
                non-zone-transfer query MUST send a UDP query first.</t></list></t>

            <t> This requirement is hereby relaxed. A resolver MAY elect to send either TCP or UDP
                queries depending on local operational reasons. TCP MAY be used before sending any
                UDP queries. If it already has an  open TCP connection to the server it SHOULD reuse
                this connection. In essence, TCP should be considered a valid alternative transport
                to UDP, not purely a fallback option.</t>

            <t> In addition it is noted that all Recursive and Authoritative servers
                MUST send responses using the same transport as the query arrived on. In
                the case of TCP this MUST also be the same connection. </t>

                           resources, it should wait until the connection has been idle for a period
                           on the order of two minutes. In particular, the server should allow the
                           SOA and AXFR request sequence (which begins a refresh operation) to be
                           made on a single connection. Since the server would be unable to answer
                           queries anyway, a unilateral close or reset may be used instead of
                           graceful close.</t></list></t>

                <t> Other more modern protocols (e.g., <xref target="RFC7230">HTTP/1.1</xref>)
                    have support by default for persistent TCP connections for all
                    requests. Connections are then normally closed via a 'connection close' signal
                    from one party. </t>

                <t> The description in <xref target="RFC1035"/> is clear that servers should view
                    connections as persistent (particularly after receiving an SOA), but
                    unfortunately does not provide enough detail for an unambiguous interpretation
                    of client behaviour for queries other than a SOA. Additionally, DNS does not yet
                    have a signalling mechanism for connection timeout or close, although some have
                    been proposed. </t>

                    <t> As a result there is no clear guidance today in any RFC as to when a DNS
                        client should close a TCP connection, and there are no specific
                        recommendations with regard to DNS client idle timeouts. However it is
                        common practice for clients to close the TCP connection after sending a
                        single request (apart from the SOA/AXFR case). </t>

                    <t> Many DNS server implementations use a long fixed idle timeout and default to
                        a small number of TCP connections. They also offer little by the way of TCP
                        connection management options. The disadvantages of this include:
                        <list style="symbols">
                            <t> Operational experience has shown that long server timeouts can 
                                easily cause resource exhaustion and poor response under heavy

                            <t> A modest number of clients that all concurrently attempted to

            <section title="Recommendation" anchor="recommedations">
                <t> The following sections include recommendations that are intended to result in
                    more consistent and scalable implementations of DNS-over-TCP.</t>

                <section title="Connection Re-use" anchor="reuse">
                    <t> One perceived disadvantage to DNS over TCP is the added connection setup
                        latency, generally equal to one RTT.  To amortize connection setup costs,
                        both clients and servers SHOULD support connection reuse by sending multiple
                        queries and responses over a single persistent TCP connection.</t>

                    <t> When sending multiple queries over a TCP connection implementations MUST
                        take care to check their list of outstanding DNS Message ID's before sending
                        a new query over an existing TCP connection. They MUST not re-use the DNS
                        Message ID of an in-flight query. This is especially important if the server
                        could be performing out-of-order processing (see section XX).</t>

                    <section title="Query Pipelining" anchor="pipelining">
                        <t> Due to the use of TCP primarily for zone transfer and truncated
                            responses, no existing RFC discusses the idea of pipelining DNS
                            queries over a TCP connection.</t>

                        <t> In order to achieve performance on par with UDP DNS clients SHOULD
                            pipeline their queries. When a DNS client sends multiple queries to a
                            server, it should not wait for an outstanding reply before sending the
                            next query. Clients should treat TCP and UDP equivalently when
                            considering the time at which to send a particular query.</t>
                        <t> DNS clients should note that DNS servers that do not both process
                            pipelined queries concurrently and send out-of-order responses will
                            likely not provide performance on a par with UDP. IF TCP performance is
                            of importance, clients may find it useful to use server processing times
                            as input to server and transport selection algorithms.</t>
                        <t> DNS servers (especially recursive) SHOULD expect to receive
                            pipelined queries.  The server should process TCP queries concurrently,
                            just as it would for UDP.  The handling of responses to pipelined
                            queries is covered in section YY.</t>

                <section title="Concurrency" anchor="concurrency">
                    <t> To mitigate the risk of unintentional server overload, DNS clients MUST take
                        care to minimize the number of concurrent TCP connections made to any
                        individual server. It is RECOMMENDED that for any given client - server
                        interaction there SHOULD be no more than one connection for regular queries,
                        one for zone transfers and one for each protocol that is being used on top
                        of TCP, for example, if the resolver was using TLS.</t>

                    <t> Similarly, servers MAY impose limits on the number of concurrent TCP
                        connections being handled for any particular client. These limits SHOULD be
                        much looser than the client guidelines above, because the server does not
                        know if the client IP address belongs to a single client or is, for example,
                        multiple resolvers on a single machine, or multiple clients behind NAT.
                     </t>
                </section>

                <section title="Idle Timeouts" anchor="idle">
                    <t> To mitigate the risk of unintentional server overload, DNS clients MUST take
                        care to minimize the idle time of DNS-over-TCP sessions made to any
                        individual server. It is RECOMMENDED that DNS clients should close the TCP
                        connection of an idle  sessions, unless an idle timeout has been established
                        using some other signalling mechanism. </t>

                    <t> QUESTION: Should this RECOMMENDED? Should we add "an idle session
                        that will not be immediately re-used", or even add "A client MAY use a idle
                        timeout of XX (order of ms or based on RTT of most recent response) if it
                        has operational reasons for doing so.</t>

                    <t> To mitigate the risk of unintentional server overload
                        it is RECOMMENDED that the default server application-level idle period
                        should be of the order of seconds, but no particular value is specified. In
                        practice, the idle period may vary dynamically, and servers MAY allow idle
                        connections to remain open for longer periods as resources permit. A timeout
                        of at least a few seconds is advisable for normal operations
                        to support those clients that expect the SOA and AXFR request sequence to be
                        made on a single connection as originally specified in
                        <xref target="RFC1035"/>. Servers MAY use zero timeouts when experiencing
                        heavy load such as an attack.</t>
                </section>

                <section title="Tear Down" anchor="timeouts">
                    <t> Under normal operation clients should initiate connection closing on idle
                        connections however servers may close the connection if their local idle
                        timeout policy is exceeded. Connections may be also closed by either end
                        under unusual conditions such as defending against an attack or system
                        failure/reboot.</t>

                    <t> There is currently no guidance on what a client should do in the event of
                        an unexpected closure by the server. The client could choose to re-try to
                        the same server using TCP, use TCP to connect to a different server or
                        switch to UDP.</t>

                    <t> QUESTION: There was a request on the mailing list to address this issue, but
                        not quite sure what to recommend.... Also
                        <xref target="RFC7230">HTTP/1.1</xref> states: "A client that pipelines
                        requests SHOULD retry unanswered requests if the connection closes before it
                        receives all of the the corresponding responses." Should we include
                        something similar?</t>

                    <t> If a server finds that a client has closed a TCP session, or if the
                        session has been otherwise interrupted, before all pending responses
                        have been sent then the server MUST NOT attempt to send those
                        responses. Of course the server MAY cache those responses.</t>

        <section title="Response Reordering" anchor="re-ordering">
            <t> RFC 1035 is ambiguous on the question of whether TCP responses may be reordered --
                the only relevant text is in Section 4.2.1, which relates to UDP:
                <list><t><vspace/>
                Queries or their responses may be reordered by the network, or by processing in name
                servers, so resolvers should not depend on them being returned in order.
                </t></list></t>

            <t> QUESTION: There are no known client implementations that support pipelining of
                queries but do not support out-of-order response. Therefore the recommendation for
                servers to send out-of-order responses should not adversely affected by existing
                client population. However, there was a discussion on the list that OOOP should be
                governed by new signalling in the same way as idleness, otherwise the MUST in the 
                next sentence is not backwards compatible.</t>

            <t> For the avoidance of future doubt, this requirement is clarified
                Authoritative servers and recursive resolvers are RECOMMENDED to support the sending
                of responses in parallel and/or out-of-order, regardless of the transport protocol
                in use. Stub and recursive resolvers that queries over TCP MUST be able to process
                responses that arrive in a different order to that in which the requests were
                sent.</t>

            <t> In order to achieve performance on par with UDP, recursive
                resolvers SHOULD process TCP queries in parallel and return
                individual responses as soon as they are available, possibly
                out-of-order.</t>

            <t> Since pipelined responses may arrive out-of-order, clients must take
                care to match responses to outstanding queries, using the ID
                field, port number, query name/type/class, and any other relevant
                protocol features. Failure by clients to properly match responses to outstanding
                queries can have serious consequences for inter-operability.</t>

        <section title="TCP Message Length Field" anchor="messagelength">
            <t> Some DNS servers are sensitive to timeout conditions, and
                will abort a TCP session if the first TCP window does not contain both the
                two-octet length field and the entire request message described by that length
                field. For this reason, and for reasons of efficiency, DNS clients and servers
                SHOULD therefore transmit the two-octet length field, and the message described
                by that length field, in a single TCP window. </t>

        <section title="TCP Fast Open" anchor="fastopen">
            <t> This section is non-normative.</t>

            <t> TCP fastopen <xref target="RFC7413"/> (TFO) allows data to be carried in the SYN
                packet. It also saves up to one RTT compared to standard TCP.</t>

            <t> TFO mitigates the security vulnerabilities inherent in sending data in the SYN,
                especially on a system like DNS where amplification attacks are possible, by use of
                a server-supplied cookie.  TFO clients request a server cookie in the initial SYN
                packet at the start of a new connection.  The server returns a cookie in its
                SYN-ACK. The client caches the cookie and reuses it when opening subsequent
                connections to the same server.</t>

            <t> The cookie is stored by the client's TCP stack (kernel) and persists if either the
                client or server processes are restarted.  TFO also falls back to a regular TCP
                handshake gracefully.</t>

            <t> DNS services taking advantage of IP anycast <xref target="RFC4786"/> may need to
                take additional steps when enabling TFO.From <xref target="RFC7413"> </xref>:

                    cookies across connections; its Fast Open attempts would fall back to regular

        <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
            <t> Some DNS server operators have expressed concern that wider use of DNS over TCP will
                expose them to a higher risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.</t>

            <t> Although there is a higher risk of such attacks against TCP-enabled servers,
                techniques for the mitigation of DoS attacks at the network level have improved
                substantially since DNS was first designed.</t>

            <t> To mitigate the risk of DoS attacks, DNS servers should
                provide configurable connection management options, for example:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t> total number of TCP connections </t>
                    <t> number of TCP connections per IP address</t>
                    <t> server idle timeout </t><t> total number of DNS transactions per TCP
                        connection</t>
                        <t> maximum TCP connection duration</t></list>
                No specific values are recommended for these parameters.

            <t> Readers are advised to familiarise themselves with <xref target="CPNI-TCP"/>. </t>

            <t> Operators of recursive servers should ensure that they only accept connections from
                expected clients, and do not accept them from unknown sources. In the case of UDP
                traffic, this will help protect against <xref target="RFC5358">reflector
                attacks</xref> and in the case of TCP traffic it will prevent an unknown client from
                exhausting the server's limits on the number of concurrent connections.</t>

        <section title="Summary of Advantages and Disadvantages to using TCP for DNS">
            <t> The TCP handshake generally prevents address spoofing and, therefore, the
                reflection/amplification attacks which plague UDP.</t>

            <t> TCP does not suffer from UDP's issues with fragmentation. Middleboxes are known to
                block IP fragments, leading to timeouts and forcing client implementations to "hunt"
                for EDNS0 reply size values supported by the network path. Additionally,
                fragmentation may lead to cache poisoning
                <xref target="fragmentation-considered-poisonous"/>.
              </t>

            <t> TCP setup costs an additional RTT compared to UDP queries. Setup costs can be
                amortized by reusing connections, pipelining queries, and enabling TCP Fast
                Open.</t>

            <t> TCP imposes additional state-keeping requirements on clients and servers.  The use
                of TCP Fast Open reduces the cost of closing and re-opening TCP connections.</t>

            <t> Long-lived TCP connections to anycast servers may be disrupted due to routing
                changes. Clients utilizing TCP for DNS must always be prepared to re-establish
                connections or otherwise retry outstanding queries. It may also possible for TCP
                Multipath <xref target="RFC6824"/> to allow a server to hand a connection over from
                the anycast address to a unicast address.</t>

            <t> There are many "Middleboxes" in use today that interfere with TCP over port 53
                <xref target="RFC5625"/>.  This document does not propose any solutions, other than
                to make it absolutely clear that TCP is a valid transport for DNS and must be
                supported by all implementations.</t>
            <t> A more in-depth discussion of connection orientated DNS can be found elsewhere
                <xref target="Connection-Oriented-DNS"/>.</t>

            <t>
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t> Changed updates to obsoletes RFC 5966.</t>

                    <t> Improved text in Section 4 Transport Protocol Selection to change "TCP
                        SHOULD NOT be used only for the transfers and as a fallback" to make the
                        intention clearer and more consistent.</t>

                    <t> Reference to TCP FASTOPEN updated now that it is an RFC.</t>

                    <t> Added paragraph to say that implementations MUST NOT send the TCP framing 2
                        byte length field in a separate packet to the DNS message.</t>

                    <t> Added Terminology section.</t>

                    <t> Changed should and RECOMMENDED in reference to parallel processing
                        to SHOULD in sections 7 and 8.</t>

                    <t> Added text to address what a server should do when a client closes the TCP
                        connection before pending responses are sent.</t>
                    <t> Moved the Advantages and Disadvantages section to an appendix.</t>

        <section title="Changes to RFC 5966">
            <t> This document differs from RFC 5966 in four additions:<list style="numbers"><t>
                DNS implementations are recommended not only to support TCP but to support it on an
                equal footing with UDP</t>
            <t> DNS implementations are recommended to support reuse of TCP connections</t>
          <t> DNS implementations are recommended to support pipelining and out of order processing
              of the query stream</t>
          <t> A non-normative discussion of use of TCP Fast Open is added</t></list></t>
